## Hi there 👋


<a href="https://app.daily.dev/kurianski"><img align="right" src="https://api.daily.dev/devcards/67752b47a871472b9328aacd12752504.png?r=3z0" width="280" alt="Matheus Kurianski's Dev Card"/></a>

My name is **Matheus Aquati Kurianski** and I am a 22 years old **Software Engineer** at **Nubank**

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building credit card products for underserved customers in Brazil, helping customers achieve their pre-approved credit card limit without having a financial history or even for those who were in debt in the past. I am using **Clojure** and **Datomic** with a **microservice architecture** to build a clear path to credit to those customers.

- 🏦 I previously worked at **Itaú Unibanco** as a Software Engineer and **PagSeguro PagBank** as a Data Science Intern

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Elixir** and **Phoenix** framework because I love to learn new languages and those are really interesting technologies! I also love to read about **scalability** and **data-intensive applications**.

- 👨‍💻 I have experience working with **Java, Kotlin, Clojure, SQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Datomic, AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk,** and a lot more technologies!
