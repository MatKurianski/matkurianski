My name is **Matheus Aquati Kurianski** and I am currently a **Software Engineer** at **Nubank**

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building credit card products for underserved customers in Brazil, helping customers achieve their pre-approved credit card limit without having a financial history or even for those who were in debt in the past. I am using **Clojure** and **Datomic** with a **microservice architecture** to build a clear path to credit to those customers.

- 🏦 I previously worked at **Itaú Unibanco** as a Software Engineer and **PagSeguro PagBank** as a Data Science Intern

- 🌱 I’m improving my knowledge of **Clojure** because it is one of the most fun technologies I have ever worked on! I also love to read about **scalability**, **data-intensive applications** and **software engineering** in general.

- 👨‍💻 I have experience working with **Java, Kotlin, Clojure, SQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Datomic, AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk,** and a lot more technologies!
